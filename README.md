# Awesome Group Generators

A curated, transparent list of tools for generating groups, teams, classroom groups, workshop breakout rooms, speed-networking rotations, and social-golfer schedules.

This repository publishes a review dataset, scoring methodology, correction workflow, and GitHub Pages explorer so tool owners and users can point out stale data or unfair ratings. Ratings are editorial, evidence-based, and open to correction requests.

- [`data/tools.json`](./data/tools.json) — full structured dataset
- [`data/tools.csv`](./data/tools.csv) — spreadsheet-friendly summary
- [`data/tools.schema.json`](./data/tools.schema.json) — JSON schema
- [`data/related-commercial-platforms.json`](./data/related-commercial-platforms.json) — non-ranked related commercial/sales-gated platforms
- [`data/related-commercial-platforms.schema.json`](./data/related-commercial-platforms.schema.json) — schema for the non-ranked related-platform list
- [`METHODOLOGY.md`](./METHODOLOGY.md) — scoring rubric and review rules

Current export: **185 tools**, source revision **507**, exported **2026-06-02T19:16:40+00:00**.

## Related commercial platforms

Sales-gated event platforms, enterprise matchmaking suites, coffee-chat apps, and app-store-only products are not mixed into the ranked list unless a self-serve generator, open demo, or runnable implementation can be reviewed. We track those adjacent products separately in [`data/related-commercial-platforms.json`](./data/related-commercial-platforms.json) so the main rankings stay limited to verifiable tools.

## Use-case shortlists

The shortlists below show three candidates per use case so readers can compare leading options instead of seeing only a single winner. Shortlist order reflects fit for that use case, not the global score alone.

| Use case | #1 | #2 | #3 | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Useful for serious group-generation jobs | [GroupMixer](https://www.groupmixer.app) (4.7) | [ChatGPT Pro Extended Reasoning](https://chatgpt.com/plans/pro/) (4.5) | [Social Golfer Online](https://socialgolfer.online/) (4.3) | For broad, real-world grouping problems, compare a purpose-built solver against AI-assisted custom workflows and niche schedulers. |
| Multi-round / repeat minimization | [GroupMixer](https://www.groupmixer.app) (4.7) | [Social Golfer Online](https://socialgolfer.online/) (4.3) | [Good-Enough Golfers](https://goodenoughgolfers.com/) (4) | These tools focus on repeated rounds and reducing duplicate pairings; some are broad planners while others are golf/social-golfer-specific. |
| Constraint-aware grouping | [GroupMixer](https://www.groupmixer.app) (4.7) | [ChatGPT Pro Extended Reasoning](https://chatgpt.com/plans/pro/) (4.5) | [Clever Groups](https://clevergroups.com/tryit) (4.2) | Purpose-built constraint tools fit structured rules; AI-assisted workflows can help when requirements are too idiosyncratic for a product UI. |
| Preference/self-entry matching | [Clever Groups](https://clevergroups.com/tryit) (4.2) | [BuddyMatcher](https://www.buddymatcher.co.uk/) (3.8) | [Educatarea Random Group Generator](https://educatarea.com/random-group-generator/) (4) | These are credible alternatives when participant preference capture or classroom-specific setup matters more than repeat minimization. |
| Interactive classroom or presentation reveal | [Picker Wheel Team Picker](https://pickerwheel.com/tools/random-team-generator/) (3.6) | [Classroomscreen Group Maker](https://classroomscreen.com/app/template/widget-tutorials-tutorial-group-maker-v1) (3.7) | [Online Stopwatch Random Group Generator](https://www.online-stopwatch.com/random-group-generators/) (2.7) | Use these when the act of revealing teams live is part of the activity and presentation matters as much as assignment quality. |
| Polished simple random splitters | [Wooclap Team Picker](https://tool.wooclap.com/en/free-group-maker) (3.3) | [Calcbe Team Generator](https://calcbe.com/en/tools/team-generator/) (3.8) | [Instructron Group Generator](https://instructron.com/tools/group-generator) (3.9) | Good choices when you only need quick one-off random groups and do not need a full planning workspace. |
| Mobile/native team generation | [Team Shake](https://www.rhine-o.com/www/iphone-apps/team-shake/) (4) | [ClassDojo Group Maker](https://www.classdojo.com/toolkit/groupmaker/) (2.7) | [Classroomscreen Group Maker](https://classroomscreen.com/app/template/widget-tutorials-tutorial-group-maker-v1) (3.7) | Useful when the organizer is already in a classroom/mobile app workflow. |
| Privacy-friendly browser/local options | [GroupMixer](https://www.groupmixer.app) (4.7) | [Good-Enough Golfers](https://goodenoughgolfers.com/) (4) | [Calcbe Team Generator](https://calcbe.com/en/tools/team-generator/) (3.8) | These avoid the worst ad-tech/hosted-roster patterns among the reviewed tools. |

## How to challenge a rating

If a tool changed, a feature is missing, or a rating seems unfair, please open an issue:

- **Correction request** — factual changes, broken links, feature updates
- **Rating dispute** — explain which rating seems unfair and provide evidence
- **New tool suggestion** — propose a group generator that should be reviewed

Good reports include a URL, reproduction steps, screenshots if useful, and a short explanation of why the current data is wrong. Final ratings remain editorial, but well-supported corrections are welcome.

## Scope

Included tools may be:

- random group generators
- team pickers
- classroom group makers
- breakout-room assignment tools
- social-golfer / repeat-minimization schedulers
- spreadsheet or AI workarounds when people realistically use them for grouping

Tools that do not generate groups at all may be rejected or kept only as low-rated workaround entries. Sales-gated commercial platforms and adjacent event-networking products are tracked separately and are not star-rated unless a self-serve generator, open demo, or runnable implementation can be reviewed.
